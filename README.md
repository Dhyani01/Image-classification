# Image-classification

Image recognition is the capability to identify people, places, objects, actions and writing in images.
While it is very easy for human and animal brains to recognize objects, the computers have difficulty with the same task. When we look at something like a tree or a car or our friend, we usually donâ€™t have to study it consciously before we can tell what it is. However, for a computer, identifying anything(be it a clock, or a chair, human beings or animals) represents a very difficult problem and the stakes for finding a solution to that problem are very high.

The convolutional neural networks make a conscious tradeoff: if a network is designed for specifically handling the images, some generalizability has to be sacrificed for a much more feasible solution.
 
Here I used CNN(Convolution Neural Network) to build a image classification model.

Dataset Used : CIFAR10
